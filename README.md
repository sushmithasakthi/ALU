A 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital combinational circuit designed to perform arithmetic and logical operations on 32-bit binary numbers. It is a core component of a CPU, enabling fundamental data processing tasks required by modern computing systems.

This ALU supports a variety of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, and optionally multiplication/division, as well as logical operations including AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. It can also handle bitwise shift operations like logical shift left/right and arithmetic shift right.

The operation to be executed is selected using a control signal (opcode), and the output is generated along with essential flags such as Zero, Carry, Overflow, and Negative, which provide additional information about the result.
This repository contains a modular implementation of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The design performs a wide range of arithmetic, logical, and shift operations on 32-bit binary inputs. It is structured in a clean and reusable manner, ideal for learning, simulation, or integration into larger CPU designs.# ALU
